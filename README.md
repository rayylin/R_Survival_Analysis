# R_Survival_Analysis
Nowadays a lot of businesses rely on the Subscription business model, so it is important to understand why people would stop subscribing the service. To achieve this goal, we use R to conduct a survival analysis. 

Case situation: A software company's profitability relies on how long its members pay for memberships. We want to conduct an analysis to help the business to understand what factors affect customersâ€™ length of payments? 

    Raw Data
    Column1(costomer id): ID
    Column2(start date): Date of activation 
    Column3(end date):Date of deactivation 
    Column4(good_credit):1=yes, 0=no
    Column5(rate_plan):1, 2, or 3 (the bigger number, the higher rate)
    Column6(pay_type): A1, A2, B1, C1
    Column7(event_time): How many months did the subscription last (Target)
    Column8(event_type): 0=active, 1= churn

The Result is shown below
We can use P-value to determine whether the result is significant.
"Good Credit" and "Rate Plan" both have impact on event time.
